# password-keeper

## Introduction

This is a demo cli application for storing websites you have an account with and their corresponding passwords.
This was built to help me grasp a practical understanding of primitive data types, functions and string manipulation in golang.
This also gave me a better understanding of how structs and maps work in golang

## To set this up:
1. Fork this repo with the command `git clone https://github.com/buabaj/password-keeper`.
2. From the root directory of this project, you can run this app from your cli by running `go run main.go`.
